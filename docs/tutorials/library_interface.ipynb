    "Larvaworld ships with a comprehensive set of preconfigured experiments that reflect many types of dish experiments that are conducted by experimental researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A larvaworld experiment is a set of configuration variables that describe and control various aspects of the overall virtual experiment.\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "- the environment definition (dish geometry and dimensions)\n",
    "- location, shape and intensity of sensory objects (food patches, odor sources ...)\n",
    "- the number, size and placement of larva groups\n",
    "- the larva agent configuration per group\n",
    "    - body physics\n",
    "    - behavioral modules and their parameters\n",
    "    - initial states (ie. metabolic state)\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see the number of available parameters is quite large.\n",
    "There are several preconfigured experiments available that can be launched instantly.\n",
    "In order to create your own custom experiment we recommend to start off with one of the available preconfigured experiments that best match the type of experiment you want to ran. And then modify any specific parameters you would like to customize.\n",

    "Let's walk through the steps to create a custom experiment where we want to customize the intensity of the odor landscape available in the dish.\n",
